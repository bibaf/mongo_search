 "registration" endpoints (e.g.
 creating

 users can automatically confirm their accounts by sending the confirmed_at parameter with their registration request.

 summary: Arbitrary Code Execution in Cookie Serialization
 details: The default serialization used by Plug session may result in code execution
  in certain situations. Keep in mind
 however
 the session cookie is signed
  and this attack can only be exploited if the attacker has access to your
  secret key as well as your signing/encryption salts. We recommend users to
  change their secret key base and salts if they suspect they have been leaked

  regardless of this vulnerability.

 summary: Arbitrary URL Redirect
 details: The Phoenix team designed Phoenix.Controller.redirect/2 to protect against
  redirects allowing user input to redirect to an external URL where your
  application code otherwise assumes a local path redirect. This is why the
  :to option is used for “local” URL redirects and why you must pass the
  :external option to intentionally allow external URLs to be redirected to.
  It has been disclosed that carefully crafted user input may be treated by some
  browsers as an external URL. An attacker can use this vulnerability to aid in
  social engineering attacks. The most common use would be to create highly
  believable phishing attacks.
  For example
 the following user input would pass local URL validation

  but be treated by Chrome and Firefox as external URLs:
  http://localhost:4000/?redirect=/\
example.com
  Not all browsers are affected
 but latest Chrome and Firefox will issue a get
  request for example.com and successfully redirect externally

 summary: Denial of service
 details: The use of `String.to_atom/1` in PowAssent is susceptible to denial of service attacks. In `PowAssent.Phoenix.AuthorizationController` a value is fetched from the user provided params
 and `String.to_atom/1` is used to convert the binary value to an atom so it can be used to fetch the provider configuration value. This is unsafe as it is user provided data
 and can be used to fill up the whole atom table of ~1M which will cause the app to crash.

 summary: Null Byte Injection in Plug.Static
 details: Plug.Static is used for serving static assets

 this can allow

  We recommend all applications that provide file upload functionality and
  serve those uploaded files locally with Plug.Static to upgrade immediately
  or include the fix below. If uploaded files are rather stored and served
  from S3 or any other cloud storage
 you are not affected.

 summary: Session fixation
 details: "### Impact

The use of `Plug.Session` in `Pow.Plug.Session` is susceptible to session fixation attacks if a persistent session store is used for `Plug.Session`
 such as Redis or a database. Cookie store
 which is used in most Phoenix apps
 doesnt have this vulnerability.

### Workarounds

Call `Plug.Conn.configure_session(conn
 renew: true)` periodically and after privilege change. A custom authorization plug can be written where the `create/3` method should return the `conn` only after `Plug.Conn.configure_session/2` have been called on it.

 summary: Remote Code Execution in paginator
 details: There is a vulnerability in Paginator which makes it susceptible to Remote Code Execution (RCE) attacks via input parameters to the `paginate()` function.

### Impact
There is a vulnerability in Paginator which makes it susceptible to Remote Code Execution (RCE) attacks via input parameters to the `paginate()` function. This will potentially affect all current users of `Paginator` prior to version >= 1.0.0.

### Patches
The vulnerability has been patched in version 1.0.0 and all users should upgrade to this version immediately. Note that this patched version uses a dependency that requires an Elixir version >=1.5.
